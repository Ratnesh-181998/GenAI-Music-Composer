# Tech Stack

- **Groq → LLM**
  (Used as the Large Language Model – free)

- **GitLab CI/CD → CI/CD Tool**
  Used for creating and managing CI/CD pipelines.

- **LangChain → Generative AI Framework**
  Used to interact with the LLM and build GenAI workflows.

- **GitLab → SCM (Source Code Management)**
  Used as the source code repository for the project.

- **Music21**
  Used to handle music theory concepts such as notes, chords, etc.

- **Streamlit**
  Used to build the UI / frontend of the application.

- **Docker**
  Used for containerization of the application during deployment.

- **Synthesizer**
  Used for generating sound waves (e.g., sine waves) from musical notes.

- **GCP GAR (Google Artifact Registry)**
  Used for storing Docker images.

- **GCP GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**
  Used to deploy and run the application on the cloud inside a Kubernetes cluster.

# Logical Flow

1. **LLM**: Converts text into musical notes and chords.
2. **Music21**: Processes musical theory.
3. **Generation**: Generates actual musical notes & chords.
4. **Synthesizer**: Converts notes into sound waves.
5. **Output**: Final output is the generated Music.


🔍 High-Level Flow Explanation

User input is processed by the Music LLM (Groq)

LLM generates musical notes & chords

Music21 converts theory into structured musical data

Synthesizer generates actual sound waves (music)

Streamlit UI presents and plays the output

App is containerized using Docker

GitLab CI/CD builds and pushes images to GCP Artifact Registry

GKE (Kubernetes) deploys the application at scale
